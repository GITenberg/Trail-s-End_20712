description: Ascalon was the end of the trail for thirsty cowboys who gave vent to
  their pent-up feelings without restraint. Calvin Morgan was not concerned with its
  wickedness until Seth Craddock's malevolence directed itself against him. Now he
  is determined not to emerge from the maelstrom until he has obliterated every vestige
  of lawlessness -- and assured himself of the safety of a certain dark-eyed girl.
